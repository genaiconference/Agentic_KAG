It dives into how we can create, manage, and scale generative AI agents effectively within production environments. You\\'ll learn the essential principles of AgentOps, from external tool integration and memory management to task orchestration, multi-agent systems, and Agentic RAG. By the end of the workshop, participants will have the skills to build and deploy intelligent agents that can automate complex tasks, handle multi-step processes, and operate within enterprise environments. **Prerequisites:**\\n\\n  * Basic understanding of AI/ML and LLMs (Large Language Models)\\n  * Familiarity with Python programming and using frameworks like LangChain or LangGraph\\n  * Experience with APIs and web-based tool integrations (e.g., basic knowledge of calling external APIs)\\n  * Familiarity with cloud-based environments (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) is a plus, but not required\\n\\n_***Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change.**_ [Read More  ](/datahacksummit-2025/workshops/agentops-building-and-deploying-ai-agents) Hack Sessions Detecting and Mitigating Risks in Agentic AI Bhaskarjit Sarmah Director Autonomous AI agents promise super-charged productivity but without the right guardrails they can also jailbreak, leak data, or go off-topic. In this session we will discuss about:\\n\\n  * building a lightweight agentic workflow from scratch\\n  * probing real-world vulnerabilities, AI risks\\n  * mapping your agent against the four-axis \"agentic profile\" framework for alignment and governance\\n  * applying risk-mitigation checklists distilled from risk management frameworks\\n\\n**What we will build -**  \\nIn the hands-on segment we will build a complete agent to go from blank notebook to governed production prototype. We\\'ll begin by bootstrapping a one-file Python agent with LangChain and OpenAI Functions that can plan, call external APIs, and write concise summaries. Next, we\\'ll wrap that agent with the open-source Python libraries, layering in rate-limits, PII scrubbing, and role-based tool permissions so you can see policy enforcement in action. With guardrails in place, we\\'ll shift to offense - running an automated PyTest suite populated with the red-team prompts to expose prompt-injection and tool-abuse weak spots. We\\'ll then quantify how well the patched agent stays on-mission by applying a lightweight PRISM-style alignment rubric that emits a JSON scorecard. Finally, we\\'ll wire everything into a Streamlit mini-dashboard that streams agent actions, policy hits, and manual override controls in real time, giving a turnkey template we can fork for our next project.

They can plan tasks, use tools, reflect on their actions, and even work together. But building these systems comes with real challenges like tool failures, memory issues, slow responses, and trouble tracking what\\'s going wrong. This session is based on my hands-on experience from building and deploying Agentic AI Systems over the past year. We\\'ll talk about what worked, what didn\\'t, and how to build agents that are reliable and ready for real-world use.  What we\\'ll cover: \\n\\n  * Common challenges when building and running Agentic AI systems \\n  * Key agent design patterns like tool use, planning, reflection, multi-agent setups, and router-based flows. \\n  * We\\'ll explain what works, what can go wrong, and when to use them\\n  * Best practices for managing memory and conversation history\\n  * How to monitor and evaluate Agentic AI systems using the right metrics \\n    * For monitoring: Is the agent choosing the right tools? Is the sequence of actions logical? Is the final output actually useful? \\n    * For observability: How fast does the agent respond? How often does it fail? Are its actions correct and in the right order?\\n  * You\\'ll learn how to track tool usage, errors, response quality, and timing across the full agent workflow \\n  * A quick overview of tools like LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, and ADK, and how to decide which one to use \\n  * A simple explanation of new trends like Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent communication (A2A), and context engineering. We\\'ll talk about what they actually do, how useful they are, and when to use them \\n  * Best practices to build Agentic AI Systems focusing on reliability, speed and performance\\n\\nWe\\'ll also show hands-on code examples to demonstrate how some of these ideas work in practice with tools like LangGraph, FastMCP, ADK etc.  [Read More  ](/datahacksummit-2025/sessions/building-effective-agentic-ai-systems-lessons-from-the-field) Hack Panel AutoGen vs CrewAI vs LangGraph: Battle of the Agent Frameworks Dipanjan Sarkar Head of Community and Principal AI Scientist Praneeth Paikray Senior Generative AI Specialist Mayank Aggarwal Co-Founder & CEO Sanathraj Narayan Data Science Manager Get ready for a high-stakes AI face-off as three leading multi-agent frameworks - **AutoGen** , **CrewAI** , and **LangGraph,** go head-to-head solving the __ same real-world AI problem: Building a Multi-Agent Helpdesk AI Assistant.

Read more Hack Sessions Scaling Test-time Inference Compute & Advent of Reasoning Models Jayita Bhattacharyya Data Scientist Enabling LLMs to enhance their outputs through increased test-time computation is a crucial step toward building self-improving agents capable of handling open-ended natural language tasks. This session explores how allowing a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute can impact performance on challenging prompts--an area with significant implications for LLM pretraining strategies and the trade-offs between inference-time and pretraining compute. Reasoning-focused LLMs, particularly open-source ones, are now challenging closed models with comparable performance using less compute. We\\'ll explore the mechanisms behind this shift, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning-based reward modeling. The session will cover the architectures, benchmarks, and performance of next-gen reasoning models through hands-on code walkthroughs. Topics include foundational LLM architectures (pre/post-training and inference), zero-shot CoT prompting (without RL), RL-based reasoning enhancements (beam search, Best-of-N, lookahead), and a comparison of fine-tuning strategies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Generalized Rejection-based Preference Optimization (GRPO)). Finally, we\\'ll demonstrate how to run and fine-tune models efficiently using the Unsloth.ai framework on limited compute setups.

Throughout the day, you will focus on the following key areas:\\n\\n  * Understand the full architecture and stack for building production-grade multimodal agents.\\n  * Learn to build and debug agent workflows using LangGraph and LangGraph Studio.\\n  * Implement short-term (SQLite) and long-term memory (Qdrant) systems for your agent.\\n  * Enable speech interactions using Whisper (STT) and ElevenLabs (TTS).\\n  * Integrate vision-language understanding with Llama 3.2 Vision and generate images via diffusion models.\\n  * Connect your agent to Telegram for real-time, mobile-accessible interactions.\\n\\nIn this workshop, participants will work hands-on with a cutting-edge stack of tools and technologies tailored for building multimodal, production-ready agentic applications. LangGraph serves as the backbone for orchestrating agent workflows, with LangGraph Studio enabling easy debugging and visualization. SQLite powers short-term memory within the agent, while Qdrant, a high-performance vector database, handles long-term memory for contextual awareness. Fast and efficient responses are delivered using Groq LLMs, complemented by natural voice interactions through Whisper for speech-to-text and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech synthesis. For visual intelligence, Llama 3.2 Vision interprets image inputs, and diffusion models are used to generate high-quality visuals. Finally, the complete system is integrated with the Telegram Bot API, allowing users to interact with the agent in real time via chat, voice, or image directly from their mobile devices. **Prerequisites:**\\n\\n  * Basic Python programming skills\\n  * Familiarity with LangChain or LangGraph\\n  * Basic understanding of multimodal AI concepts\\n\\n_***Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change.**_ Modules Module 1: Project Overview We\\'ll start by reviewing the architecture and tech stack, setting up the repository, installing dependencies, and configuring environment variables. Module 2: LangGraph Crash Course We\\'ll dive into the basics of **LangGraph** -- nodes, edges, conditional edges, state -- and break down how the agent\\'s \"brain\" works. You\\'ll also learn how to debug and test workflows using **LangGraph Studio**. Module 3: Building Agent Memory A deep dive into agent memory systems: using **SQLite** for short-term memory (LangGraph state) and **Qdrant** for long-term memory storage. Module 4: Speech Systems (TTS and STT) We\\'ll implement **Text-to-Speech** (with **ElevenLabs**) and **Speech-to-Text** (with **Whisper**), giving your agent the ability to listen and speak naturally. Module 5: Vision-Language Models and Image Generation We\\'ll integrate a **Vision-Language Model** to interpret images and a **Diffusion Model** to generate realistic, high-quality images. Module 6: Connecting to Telegram Finally, we\\'ll connect the full agent backend to a **Telegram Bot** -- enabling real-time conversations, image processing, and voice interactions directly on your phone. By the end of the module, I\\'ll also share practical tips on how to improve the system further and specialize it for different business use cases. _*Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change._ Instructor [ ](/datahacksummit-2025/speakers/miguel-otero-pedrido) [Miguel Otero Pedrido](/datahacksummit-2025/speakers/miguel-otero-pedrido) [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/migueloteropedrido/) [ ML Engineer|Founder ](/datahacksummit-2025/speakers/miguel-otero-pedrido)'), Document(metadata={'url': 'https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/datahacksummit-2025/workshops/build-a-production-ready-multi-agent-application-with-crewai', 'section': 'Workshops'}, page_content='Mastering Real-World Multi-Agent Systems 23 August 2025 | 09:30AM - 05:30PM | [ location RENAISSANCE :- Race Course Rd, Madhava Nagar Extension  ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Renaissance+Bengaluru+Race+Course+Hotel/@12.9842841,77.576425,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9106578b44413795?sa=X&ved=1t:2428&ictx=111) About the workshop In this hands-on technical workshop, we\\'ll explore multi-agent orchestration using CrewAI, diving into how autonomous agents can collaborate to solve complex problems. You\\'ll learn how to define, configure, and coordinate agents using CrewAI\\'s core components, all in Python. We\\'ll walk through the main classes of problems this approach is suited for and guide you step by step through building real-world workflows. Topics include agent creation, orchestration strategies, tool integration (including custom tools), and LLM-agnostic setups. We\\'ll also look at how to connect CrewAI with external libraries such as Streamlit to bring your solutions to life. What You\\'ll Learn:\\n\\n  * How to define agents and tasks in CrewAI\\n  * Coordinating agents through orchestration flows\\n  * Using and creating tools and custom tools\\n  * Working with different LLMs (LLM-agnostic setups)\\n  * Integrating with libraries like Streamlit\\n  * Best practices for building maintainable and scalable agent systems\\n\\n**Prerequisites:**\\n\\n  * Basic Python knowledge (e.g., installing packages, creating environments, defining classes)\\n  * Please come prepared with:\\n  * An OpenAI API key (or another LLM provider)\\n  * A Serper.dev API key\\n\\n_***Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change.**_ Modules Module 1: Introduction to CrewAI and Multi-Agent Systems Kick off the workshop with a clear overview of what CrewAI is and why it\\'s a game-changer in the realm of agent-based systems. We\\'ll discuss the motivation behind multi-agent orchestration, walk through CrewAI\\'s core and advanced components (agents, tasks, tools, crews, flows), and map these to real-world business use cases such as content generation, fraud detection, customer service, and onboarding. You\\'ll also get an outline of the workshop structure and what to expect in each module.\\n\\n  * Why multi-agent systems?\\n  * Core components: agents, tasks, crews, tools, flows\\n  * Advanced features: conditional logic, async orchestration, LLM-agnostic setups\\n  * Business case examples and architectural patterns\\n\\nModule 2: Get Started with CrewAI – Hands-On Fundamentals In this hands-on session, you\\'ll set up your environment and build your very first CrewAI application. Learn by doing: define a basic agent, assign it a task, and compose a simple crew. This module ensures all participants are equipped with working installations and a clear understanding of the basics.\\n\\n  * Environment setup (virtualenv/conda, dependencies)\\n  * Installing and configuring CrewAI\\n  * Creating your first agent and task\\n  * Forming your first crew and running a workflow\\n\\nModule 3: Content Creation with Guardrails using Flows Here, you\\'ll build a content creation application using agents and flows, with built-in \"guardrails\" for maintaining quality, relevance, or tone. Learn how to define conditional orchestration strategies to guide the process across multiple agents, each responsible for different steps in content generation.\\n\\n  * Using flow for conditional task execution\\n  * Implementing content generation with validation steps\\n  * Guardrails through intermediate agents\\n  * Real-world use case: blog/social media content generation\\n\\nModule 4: Fraud Detection with Pattern Recognition Agents Design a fraud detection pipeline using agents trained to analyze transaction logs and behaviors. This scenario introduces a more data-driven approach, integrating tools and heuristics for pattern recognition and classification.\\n\\n  * Parsing and structuring transaction data\\n  * Agents for anomaly detection and classification\\n  * Using external tools (e.g., regex, statistical tests)\\n  * Workflow coordination and response generation\\n\\nModule 5: Intelligent Onboarding & Persistent Memory with Mem0 Create an AI-powered onboarding system that adapts to users through personalized interactions. Leverage persistent memory (via mem0) to build context-aware conversations across sessions and allow agents to learn and recall user preferences.\\n\\n  * Designing agent memory with mem0\\n  * Personalized task flow for onboarding\\n  * Integration with user input tools (forms, questionnaires)\\n  * Memory persistence strategies for long-term agent behavior\\n\\nModule 6: Final Project – Conversational Agent with Streamlit and Voice I/O Wrap up the workshop with a capstone project: a multi-agent interview simulator with Streamlit. This end-to-end application connects CrewAI agents to a front-end UI and includes voice-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities for a seamless conversational experience. This module ties together everything learned so far and provides a production-style template for real-world applications.\\n\\n  * Creating an interactive front-end with Streamlit\\n  * Setting up voice interfaces (text-to-speech, speech-to-text)\\n  * Orchestrating a crew for mock interviews\\n  * Connecting UI, tools, and CrewAI agents into a coherent system\\n\\n_*Note: These are tentative details and are subject to change._ Instructor [ ](/datahacksummit-2025/speakers/alessandro-romano) [Alessandro Romano](/datahacksummit-2025/speakers/alessandro-romano) [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-romano-1990/) [ Senior Data Scientist ](/datahacksummit-2025/speakers/alessandro-romano)')]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThought: I now know the final answer.\n",
