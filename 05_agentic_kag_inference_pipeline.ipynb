            "- The community features hands-on workshops and hack sessions focused on productionizing GenAI and agentic systems, including RAG with Qdrant, which is directly relevant to Agentic RAG. Kartik Nighania (Typewise) leads an end-to-end LLMOps workshop and a hack session on engineering reliable agents at scale, both of which include RAG with Qdrant as a core topic [Data: Entities (15, 29, 435, 466, 16), Relationships (633, 1299, 3, +more)].\n",

            "- The deep-dive LangGraph workshop centers on graph-based agentic workflows, explicitly incorporating retrieval+reasoning (RAG) as a core component. Additionally, a hands-on Hack Panel compares frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph) by building a multi-agent Helpdesk AI Assistant, covering retrieval+reasoning and agentic workflows—key aspects of Agentic RAG [Data: Reports (LangGraph workshop, Hack Panel)].\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Agentic AI for Customer Experience\n",
            "- A demo-driven hack session co-presented by Pavak Biswal (DGS) and Abhilash Kulkarni (Dentsu) operationalizes Agentic AI Triage and utilizes RAG to transform at-risk customers into retained advocates via a GenAI-powered CX playbook. The session covers churn detection, retention, sentiment analysis, and more, all supported by Agentic AI Triage and RAG [Data: Reports (main data table, no explicit ids)].\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Real-World Agentic AI Applications\n",
            "- Pradeep Kumar (Emirates Airlines) leads a hands-on session on building agentic AI that fuses computer vision and LLMs for access control, alerts, and logging, incorporating safeguards such as confidence thresholds and human-in-the-loop logic. This session demonstrates practical use of agentic RAG. Deepak Sharma’s session addresses reliability in agentic systems and discusses human-in-the-loop workflows and tools like Pydantic-AI, relevant to agentic RAG in operational domains [Data: Reports (Pradeep Kumar session, Deepak Sharma session)].\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Healthcare Voice AI Contact Center\n",
            "- A hack session focuses on a scalable healthcare Voice AI contact center, featuring real-time multimodal agents and agentic frameworks, indicating the use of Agentic RAG in a hands-on, production-focused workshop setting. Practitioners with expertise in ML and agentic frameworks participate, supporting the likelihood of Agentic RAG methodologies being demonstrated [Data: Reports (none, as no explicit report ids provided)].\n",

            "- A Day 3 hack session led by Bhaskarjit Sarmah (Domyn) covers agentic AI and RAG concepts (e.g., rate limits, PII scrubbing, role-based tool permissions, monitoring) using LangChain and OpenAI Functions, though not explicitly labeled as \"Agentic RAG\" [Data: Reports (session description)].\n",
